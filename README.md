#  Project #3: <u>HOMEPAGE</u>
### <u>Overview</u>

Homepage, is your NEW <b>HOMEPAGE</b>! 

Begin your daily routine with quick access to weather, google search, a random giphy display and jokes. This functionality uses requests to several APIs.

Members can log in via Facebook or they may enroll with their own email and password.

### <u>Team Build Approach</u>


We met and conceptually decided upon building a <b>‘homepage’</b> because it would allow us the most opportunities to work with various APIs. We spent an afternoon producing wire frames and building out our basic architecture.

We divided up large tasks to begin building the major features of our project. We assisted, shifted, and modified roles as we encountered problems and leveraging strengths.

Begrudgingly, we had to cease work on the embedded Facebook and Twitter feeds.

### <u>Homepage Metamorphosis</u>

Our original homepage layout included an embedded feed for a member’s own Facebook and Twitter account. However, it proved not to be viable for either embedded option. We could get our “own homepage app page” to display, but otherwise individual member feeds are locked down.

We also tried to incorporate geolocation to populate the weather display instead of manually asking for the member’s zipcode. Unfortunately, the weather app would not function correctly with exact member latitude and longitude coordinates.

P.S. Don hopes Sound Cloud can be added soon, so he can hear his tunes!

Brad Bakalar is a crazy biker bro from Reno, Nevada. Brad hates watching television, too many trashy shows. But he would like an easy way to check the weather and see if it is optimal to take his french poodle, Moki, out for her walk and then for a ride.

Brad is also not a fan of social media.

Wonder Woman is a busy crime fighting, invisible plane flying,  super hero! After dealing with the low-life scumb of the world, she just wants to sit back, relax, and look at cute pictures of dogs and cats.

Also, prior to starting her day, she may need to search the web for information of the habits of criminals.

- Wonder Woman is able to sign in via her Facebook account.
- Wonder Woman is able to check the weather conditons.
- Wonder Woman is able to do a Google search of the Joker, and gain valuable intel to stop his evil plans.
- Wonder Woman can search for pictures of kittens and puppies.
